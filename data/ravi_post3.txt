If I could go back in my data science journey, something I'd do differently is specialize in a cloud tool earlier.

Now I chose AWS, and if you’re considering the same, a few of the most important tools here are:

- AWS Glue for ETL jobs.
- AWS S3 for storage.
- AWS SageMaker for model building.

I actually did a blog post on a mini-project that uses all of these, check it out: https://ravinderrai[dot]com/predicting-gaming-behavior-with-aws/
