If you think feature engineering is obsolete, you’re not looking close enough.

A lot of people think LLMs killed it off.

But in practice, feature engineering still shows up everywhere in real-world ML:

🔹 Tabular data: XGBoost and LightGBM still thrive on carefully crafted features where transformations and domain knowledge can make or break results - this hasn’t changed.

🔹 Embeddings as features: For text, images, and graphs - embeddings are the new feature engineering. Picking the right representation matters more than ever.

🔹 Multimodal pipelines: Combining structured + unstructured data isn’t automatic. Designing how features interact across modalities is still feature engineering.

The tools may look new.

 But the mindset behind feature engineering remains.
