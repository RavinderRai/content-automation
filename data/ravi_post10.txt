Most ML projects don’t fail because of the model - they fail because of everything around it.

It’s easy to obsess over accuracy and benchmarks.
But the real world has different failure modes.

Here are the ones I’ve seen more often:

🔹 Data pipelines breaking: great model, useless output - if your data flow isn’t reliable, the system is doomed from the start.

🔹 Metrics that don’t match business goals: 95% accurate model doesn’t matter if it’s optimizing for the wrong thing. Alignment is everything.

🔹 Lack of monitoring: without drift detection or alerts, small issues quietly turn into big problems.

The model is just one piece of the puzzle.

 It’s the ecosystem around it that decides whether it’s a demo… or a product.
