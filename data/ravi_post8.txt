Before you build a product, build fake data.

Especially in the LLM era, where access to real, labeled data can be your biggest bottleneck.

But here's the catch:

Simply prompting an LLM to generate some examples isn't enough — and asking for it in a chat window definitely isn’t.

It’s not about replacing real data — it’s about unblocking yourself before you have it.

But if you go this route, you still need a repeatable, programmable pipeline — just like you would for real data.

Here’s what I’ve learned:

🔹 Structure it like a real pipeline
 Write scripts or functions to generate samples. Control distributions. Add edge cases. Make it reproducible.
🔹 Add variation and noise intentionally
 Inject randomness, misspellings, and incomplete fields early. No two inputs should look exactly alike.
🔹 Mimic real-world constraints
 Time formats, currencies, multilingual data, corrupted inputs — all of this matters when your prototype hits production.
🔹 Use it for both training and evaluation

Synthetic data can act as a controlled benchmark. Don’t just train on it - use it to stress-test your system.

Personally, I’ve used definitely used synthetic pipelines to test LLM workflows and train classification models before I had real labels.

And every time, it helped me move faster — and build smarter.
