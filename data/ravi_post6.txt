When I first started learning Data Science:

- Coding was the focus of the work.
- It felt like a blend of programming and math.
- Neural Networks seemed like cool science fiction.

But the deeper I got, the more I realized:

- Data Science is dead.
- Coding is a waste of time.
- Machine Learning Engineering is where its at.
