This 1 mindset shift changed everything. 

When I first started learning data science, I focused on:

 - a fun problem to solve
 - the latest Kaggle dataset
 - trying all the coolest models
 - thinking the best model is valuable

But that mindset results in little impact. The real value comes from:

 - a real-world problem to solve
 - hunting for relevant and quality data yourself
 - not worrying about the model too much, especially early on
 - considering how your ML solution is actually tied to the revenue

Thinking about the surrounding aspects of ML is how it actually becomes useful.
