Freelancing Lesson: Everyone wants AI, but nobody wants to deal with crappy data.

I’ve seen this pattern repeat again and again:

⚫ Unreliable Data Sourcing: Data is scattered, schemas are inconsistent, and nothing flows reliably. A model on top? Good luck.
⚫ Labeling gaps: supervised learning is king - but nobody is prepared for the grind of labeling.
⚫ Quality issues: Duplicates, nulls, silent errors… accuracy dies long before the model gets blamed.

As they always say in ML.

Garbage in.
Garbage out.
