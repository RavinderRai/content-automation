Everyone says it’s dead… until the one time it suddenly isn’t.

Look, most of the time, you won’t need fine-tuning:

- Hallucinations won’t magically disappear.
- Retrieval with prompting can cover knowledge gaps pretty well.
- Monitoring plus feedback loops give you more leverage than model makeover.

But sometimes there are cases where it is worth opening the box:

- When you need a model to mimic a specific style/voice at scale.
- When a smaller model must compress knowledge from a larger one.
- When you want to inject genuinely new capabilities, not just rephrase answers.

It’s not that it’s dead. 
It’s just not usually the answer you’re looking for.

The real skill isn’t knowing how to fine-tune.
It’s knowing when to fine-tune.
