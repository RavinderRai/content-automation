LLMs won’t replace traditional ML — they’ll just make it easier to build.

Too many people see LLMs as the product.

But some of the most powerful use cases have them behind the scenes - quietly enhancing traditional ML workflows.

Here’s how I’ve seen it work (and used it myself):

🔹 Synthetic label generation
Need a few thousand labeled examples? LLMs can kickstart the process when real labels are scarce - great for bootstrapping models.

🔹 Feature extraction
PDFs, screenshots, transcripts, web pages - LLMs are great at turning these into structured formats that plug right into ML pipelines.

🔹 Data transformation
Instead of regex hell, use LLMs to normalize categories, clean messy text fields, or even guess missing values with context.

There’s a ton you can do when you stop thinking of LLMs as chatbots - and start using them as tools.

Traditional ML isn’t dead.
It’s just getting an upgrade.
